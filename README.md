# Add Recent Tags
## Use Case

I add notes on a per-chapter basis, in chunks based on each topic within the chapter, so I wanted a tool to quickly add that chapter tag to each chunk as I added it. Scrolling down in the sidebar, right-clicking, and clicking 'Add tag to selected notes' is fine, but I can go even faster with this tool. Save your precious study time, don't be procrastinating via post-processing.
